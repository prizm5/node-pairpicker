# node-pairpicker

Pairpicker is an Angular (beta unfortunately) and nodejs application that uses CouchDB as a database.

## [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/)

You will need a CouchDB database. Once created, add db/teams.json as a normal document and db/views.json as a Design document.


## config.js

In order to run the site locally, you will need to set the database name in the config.js
``` 
config.dbname = 'dev_data';
```
